Social Recipe is a social media app dedicated to revolutionize the way people discover, make, and share recipes. While there are many recipes on apps such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, the process of watching the video, getting the recipe, and checking out remains fragmented. Some influencers have their recipe in the description, some have their own dedicated website, and others make you comment to receive the recipe. We address these challenges by unifying all these recipes into an app where users are shown recipes in a TikTok (infinite scroll) fashion with likes and comments. 

With a single tap, users can then add recipe ingredients to a grocery list, which they can then checkout to a delivery service like InstaCart. Users can create shared “cookbooks” with friends of the recipes they want to make, and post their own recipes to become a chefluencer.
